i like http://espn.sportsbox.com/en/formula1-fantasy a lot.  as the site of
choice for the cardorks' fantasy f1 exploits it's much nicer than
http://www.f1grandprixmanager.com which we've used for years.  the latter has fallen
into disrepair and is quite frankly a ghetto now.  but, as nice as sportsbox is,
it does have its shortcomings as far as the data that's exposed.

so i thought i'd make a screen scraper, populate a sqlite3 db, and see what
secret insights i can divine from ye olde data....

setup
1) install perl
2) install sqlite
3) perl loader.pl
4) query away on db table 'f1_2011'
